I'll post here my solutions for the https://projecteuler.net/,
it should respect the one-minute rule.
Don't read if you hasn't solve the problem by yourself, or read it, I'm just a README you knowâ€¦
It's mostly written in Java but some quick calculations are done using bash or python.

## Quick and dirty
Most of the source is not commented but respect Java convention so it should be undertandable.

## Follow my progress
I don't push my progress after every problem.
